## Jerbo CMS

My own CMS in Laravel

- Uses *Modules*
- Each module uses one *Gestor*, this is a "manager", that will be working with group of inputs types. All it's saved in DB, and the forms of the CMS are dinamically rendered from there
- *Categories*

This CMS it's mixed with a client's project, so there a lot of front involved too, that's no related to de CMS.
